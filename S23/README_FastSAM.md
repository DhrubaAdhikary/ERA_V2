# Car Detection using FastSAM

## Introduction

The Fast Segment Anything Model (FastSAM) is a CNN-based segmentation model, developed using only 2% of the SA-1B dataset. Despite the limited training data, FastSAM achieves performance on par with the original Segment Anything Model (SAM) while operating 50 times faster.

## Model Checkpoints

FastSAM offers many model versions with different sizes. You can download the checkpoints for each version through the following links:

In the demonstration below, the default FastSAM model is used.

As illustrated above, FastSAM effectively identifies and segments documents, disregarding the background without any additional training. This makes it an excellent tool for cropping and background removal in images.
